Some of the arquives in this folder can apresent few bugs or bad function while they are running, this is because,
for some reason, the functions 'func_get_args()' and 'func_num_args()' have some strange behauvor when they are relataded with
inputs of users in client-side, and i don't know to fix this right now, with that said, i'm sorry and you was warned about the erros;
